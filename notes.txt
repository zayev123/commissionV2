n random m length sequences where each m-length sequence will behave as an element of the tensor

the key is to figue out these covariance factos and see how they compae with the actual

volume traded should be a function of the expected next price, assuming that insider trading is 
at play

volume traded will be based on market sentiment, but, it will keep track of past two time steps
and another of past 10 time steps, if the price has increased in the past 10, but decreased in past 2,
people are likely to sell.

on the othe hand, if price has decreased in past 10, but increased in past 2, people ae likely to buy.
when people are likely to buy, increase the next price futher by a small weight.

but, also sell, if there is another very fast rising stock, even though this stock also rose

so, like stock_a rose gradually by 5%, and all others also gradually rose, 
but one stock made a reversal in 2 consecutive timesteps, so the ones making the reversals,
would gain volume, in the proportion of their gains, and the ones .

another thing to note is the price. more people are likely to buy more volume of a
cheaper stock with the same rate of incease.

simulating the volume traded will be the real tricky part

also consider updating the gradients in the middle, to see how the model 
adapts

hmm, maybe I should update the state based on my answers, but I should not update the rewards

because the state should be my source of truth

I never keep less than one share in the company

first sell all, then buy all

it masks the input for the selected action. well, I am selecting all the actions.
